Array for city_distances
Array for fuel
mpg = 10

Function 1: getStartingCity()
Get the starting city as an input. (Note: from every city should be possible to have a cycle)
Return the starting city after user input

Function 2: getRemainingFuel()
Get the calculation for the fuel
    for loop to traverse each city and add/remove the fuel amount from traversal
        add fuel += mpg * fuel[i] (Since starting at 0, need to add first)
        remove fuel - city_distances[i]
        Note: If starting at 3, how can I wrap back to 3?

        remaining fuel = add fuel - remove fuel

    return the remaining fuel after loop.
